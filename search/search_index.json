Applying for life insurance doesn't have to be hard. We are transforming the process to make it as simple as possible. The entire process can be summed up into 6 steps: Apply Sign TI/Para Underwriting Decision Accept/Decline The flowchart below describes the steps. How do you buy life insurance? There are three main ways to buy life insurance: You can go directly to a life insurance company online (like TD bank) You can go through an independent local insurance broker You can buy insurance from an independent broker online Whats the pros and cons of each option? Are some of these ways better than others? Yes. Buying life insurance from an independent broker (either local or online) is always a smart decision. Why? Because agents who work for a single life insurance provider won't help you get life insurance policy quotes from a variety of companies to make sure you get a reasonable price. Life insurance prices are very complicated and can vary widely across companies for the same type of policy. So unless you want to spend more than you have to on life insurance, it\u2019s essential to shop around and compare quotes. Remember though, the first step to buying life insurance is to figure out how much you actually need. This amount depends on your household (having a spouse or kids who depend on you) and your financial situation. For example, do you have debts to pay? Will your family need to replace your income to cover their everyday living expenses? Do you want to fund a college education for your children?","title":"Step 5: How to Apply"},{"location":"applying/#how-to-apply","text":"","title":"How to Apply"},{"location":"applying/#how-do-i-apply-for-life-insurance","text":"Applying for life insurance doesn't have to be hard.

In its simplest form, life insurance is a security blanket for your loved ones. It is there to protect anyone who depends on you financially in the worst-case scenario What is term insurance? Term life insurance is designed to be simple. \u200b\u200bYou pay premiums each month to an insurance company over an agreed length of time. In return, the insurance company promises to give your loved ones a tax-free lump sum cash payment (the \u201cdeath benefit\u201d) if you die. Term life insurance pays out a benefit to your beneficiaries only if you die within a specified timeframe, usually 10, 20, or 30 years. This is the best option if you want protection for the years that matter most (when you still have a mortgage & children in the house). What's the difference between permanent and term insurance? There are two main types of life insurance: term & permanent. Term life insurance is the simplest and most affordable form of life insurance. It pays out a benefit to your beneficiaries only if you die within a specified timeframe, usually 10, 20, or 30 years. This is the best option for 95% of young families. The alternative (permanent policies) are much more expensive \u2013 we are talking hundreds of dollars a month more expensive. Why? Because it guarantees that your beneficiaries will receive a death benefit. You can die young or die old, and your insurance company will still pay out. These policies generate high commissions for advisors. But we don\u2019t like them. For most adults, by the time they\u2019ve reached retirement, they have decided that their savings are enough to support themselves & their families for the rest of their life.

There are many factors that influence the cost of life insurance. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to find the best rate for the amount of life insurance you want to buy. Here are the main factors that will impact your price: - Age - Gender - Smoking status - Personal health - Driving history - Risky hobbies Let\u2019s talk about each of these individually. Your age \u2013 It\u2019s more likely that a 60-year-old will pass away in the next 20 years than a 20-year-old will. That\u2019s why for a 20-year policy, the 60-year-old will end up paying quite a bit more than the 20-year-old. Sorry, folks. There\u2019s no senior\u2019s discount here. Gender \u2013 Believe it or not, this will impact your price. Women are more likely to outlive men. (In fact, their average life expectancy is about 3 years longer.) This means women will get slightly lower prices. Smoking status \u2013 Smoking can harm your health and increase your risk of an early death in many ways. And you can bet that insurance companies know this. That\u2019s why smokers are considered to be about 2x as risky for a life insurance company than nonsmokers and will, therefore, get double the rates compared to their nonsmoking counterparts. The good news is that if you ever stop smoking, insurers will reward you for that! Smokers can always get their rates lowered after the fact (as long as they stop smoking for 12 months straight). So if you were looking for another reason to quit, this is it! Personal health \u2013 When you apply for life insurance, insurers scrutinize your health. If you\u2019ve recently had a heart attack or stroke or have had a severe illness in the last 5 years, life insurance companies will increase your rates. The important thing when applying for insurance is to be honest about your health history. Lying about your health is insurance fraud and could lead to a claim being denied, which is MUCH worse than having to pay a higher rate. Driving history \u2013 Driving accidents are a leading cause of death in Canada. That\u2019s why insurance companies will ask if you\u2019ve been in any major driving accidents in the last few years. If you\u2019ve had a DUI or a careless driving charge, this could impact your rates too. When insurers look at your driving history, the last 3 to 5 years carry the most weight. Risky hobbies \u2013 If you\u2019re a frequent skydiver or an amateur pilot, you\u2019re probably at a higher risk of an accidental death than the average Canadian without these hobbies is. For this reason, your rate or policy may be impacted by these hobbies. How do insurance companies collect information on all of these factors? Most of them will ask you to jump on a quick phone call with one of their healthcare professionals to go through 20\u201330 questions about your health and lifestyle. Some life insurance providers also require a medical exam to assess basic metrics like height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. They\u2019ll use this data to make a final decision about the price of your policy.","title":"Step 4: Products"},{"location":"products/#products","text":"","title":"Products"},{"location":"products/#how-is-life-insurance-priced","text":"There are many factors that influence the cost of life insurance.
