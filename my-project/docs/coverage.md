# What Is Covered

## What causes of death are covered?

All causes of death are included (health or non-health related). The only exception is suicide during the first two years that you hold the policy. Given the risk of anti-selection when it comes to suicide (for example, someone buying life insurance right before taking their own life), insurance companies exclude death benefit claims as a result of a suicide during the first two years.
