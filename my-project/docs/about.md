# About PolicyMe

## How does PolicyMe make money?

As a licensed brokerage, we get paid commissions on every policy we sell. These commissions are paid to us directly by the insurance companies, so there are no charges to you beyond the premiums you pay if you purchase a policy.

## Is PolicyMe affiliated with any insurance companies?

We are not affiliated with any insurance companies. We are an independent third-party broker, meaning we can sell life insurance products from whichever companies we choose.  We went through a rigorous process of analyzing each insurance companyâ€™s products, prices, and customer experience and handpicked the ones that will deliver the best overall value to our customers.

## Are PolicyMe life insurance advisors commissioned?

No, and we think that's a good thing!

Our life insurance advisors are non-commissioned, so you can rest assured that you are getting the best recommendations for you and your family, which will set you up for long term success.
